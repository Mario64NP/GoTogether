# GoTogether

GoTogether is a backend REST API designed to help people find companions for events. The platform allows users to browse events, view individuals looking for companions, and signal their own interest.

## The Concept
The service operates on a simple interest-based workflow:
* **Event Discovery:** Users can view upcoming events (concerts, raves, etc.)
* **Interest List:** Each event maintains a list of users looking for a group or a partner
* **Participation:** Users can add themselves to the list and include a short note to provide context to others (e.g., "Looking for a ride" or "Have an extra ticket")

## Technical Environment and Setup

### Requirements
* Visual Studio 2026 (.NET 10 & C# 14)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mario64NP/GoTogether
